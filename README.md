# GitHub Pages for OData Web API Samples

## Writing a new post

The site is available at http://odata.github.io/WebApi/.

To add a new sample, add a new markdown file to the `_posts` folder.

The file name follows the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-the-file.md`.

The file content should start with some metadata:

```
---
layout: post
title: "Title of the Sample Post"
description: ""
category: 
---
```

## Hosting the site locally for testing purpose

The site uses Jekyll for hosting the markdown files. If you want to host the site locally for testing purpose, follow the documentations on the Jekyll website: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/.
